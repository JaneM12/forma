I made this website to showcase the font "Forma DJR" by David Jonathan Ross. Forma DJR, a revival of classic italian sans, was released to the public in 2016. This was my first time using a Variable font and creating a font specimen website. It was interesting to see how forma animated on the website, and to add different animations to text. It was also interesting experimenting with the different font variations. Making this website helped me understand more of the basics of CSS and html animations and layout. 

I created mockups for the website on Figma, which helped me learn more about site layout and design. I found inspiration from other type specimen websites online. I used the class Nav bar code. I started using vw sizing instead of px for a more responsive website design. I used hover transitions for the forma varations section, Axis header, Characters header, and the download button. Animations were used for the Forma tiles, and the different axis of the font.
